Module      : WayUtil.Timing
Description : Base module to provide timing for other modules
Maintainer  : ongy
Stability   : testing
Portability : Linux

This modules is supposed to be used by others to provide functionality that
depends on the time passed since the compositor started.

The main usage is over 'getBasedTime' which provides the time in nanoseconds
since the compositor started (roughly).

A common usage in other code would be:

>seconds <- getSeconds <$> getBasedtime
>if seconds < 300
>    then -- When in first 5 minutes --
>    else -- otherwise --
