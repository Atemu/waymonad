Module      : ViewSet
Description : The basic classes used for managing the Waymoand ViewSet
Maintainer  : ongy
Stability   : testing
Portability : Linux

This module provides the basic classes that should be implemented by ViewSet types
and used by any functions that work with the ViewSet to allow sharing most Layouts and
interaction models between different internal representations.

-- | The basic class the workspace identifier should implement.

    -- | Get a human-readable representation of the workspace name
    getName :: a -> Text

instance WSTag Text where
    getName = id

-- | Meta-class to allow handling generic layouts
class LayoutClass a where
    -- | Handle a message, update internal state and return `Just new` if
    -- things changed
    handleMessage :: a -> SomeMessage -> Maybe a
    -- | Update internal state on the message and forward it to *all*
    -- sublayouts so those can update as well
    broadcastMessage :: a -> SomeMessage -> Maybe a
    -- | Static description of the Layout. Should not need to introspect the
    -- argument
    description :: a -> Text
    -- | Dynamic up to date description of the Layout. This should introspect
    -- the argument and give an overview of what's currently used
    --
    -- Defaults to 'description'
    currentDesc :: a -> Text
    currentDesc = description

-- | Utility type to group layouts
data Layout = forall l. LayoutClass l => Layout l

-- | Message class to allow updating layout state
class Typeable m => Message m

-- | Utility type for properly typing functions on messages. Use 'getMessage'
-- to get the original message.

-- | Get the original message out of a 'SomeMessage'
getMessage :: Message m => SomeMessage -> Maybe m

{- | The main class required to be implemented for ViewSet types.

This class will be required by the core. It allows to set and retrieve focused windows and add/remove windows to and from the ViewSet.

This is a somewhat limited set of functionality and should be supplimented by type specific functions or other instances like 'ListLike'.
